# Pandish

Pandish is a recommender android application designed for customers who like to try trending dishes and restaurants. I used the rating and sentimental analysis of user reviews to determine the popularity of a given dish and restaurant. The candidate dishes were first mined from user reviews using a phrase mining technique called AutoPhrase. Then we computed the rank of the mined dishes by considering the sentiment of positive and negative information where the given dish is mentioned. After ranking the dishes, we identified the popularity of each restaurant with the given dish.
